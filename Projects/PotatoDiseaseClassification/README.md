# Potato Disease Classification

Potatoes might have diseases such as blight. This project uses a CNN to classify if a potato plant is healthy or has early/late blight. 

## Data
You can get the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). I have downloaded it into this directory. Then I have unzipped the folder. Inside newly created foldder, I have deleted every folder, that does not start with "Potato".
